## Version Control with Git

Version control is essential for managing changes in your codebase. It allows you to track modifications, understand who made changes, and why.

## Glossary üìö
Below are some key terms you'll encounter:

- **Version Control:** A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- **Git Branch:** A parallel version of your codebase where commits are organized. Each branch can develop features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.
- **Master/Main Branch:** The primary branch that contains the production-ready version of your code. This is the version delivered to your users.
- **Pull Request:** A formal request to merge changes from one branch to another. It allows for code review and ensures changes are introduced in a controlled manner.


## Benefits of Version Control

Some of the advantages of using Version Control are: 


- **üóÇÔ∏è Backup:** It offers you a place to store all the project files. Multiple versions of the same files can coexist, so you can easily roll back the files to any point in the past if someone introduces unwanted changes.
- **üìñ History:** Having the complete history of changes in a file helps you troubleshoot bugs and compare changes over time. The file history can tell when the file was created or deleted and the edits that were made. 
- **üí¨ Better Understanding:** All the changes are signed off. Every time you save a change in a file, you must enter a short description of what was changed. These written notes, along with the author and the date, are tracked in the file history. This is vital to identify who introduced the issue and when. 
- **ü§ù Better Collaboration:** A branch-based structure keeps multiple streams of work independent of one another while still allowing you to merge the work together, thus verifying that there are no conflicting changes in the branches.
